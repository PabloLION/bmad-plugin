## Plugin Description

BMAD Method (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development) provides a
complete agile development lifecycle inside Claude Code. It includes 10
specialized agents (architect, PM, scrum master, developer, UX designer, test
engineer, and more) and 30+ skills covering planning, architecture, sprint
management, testing, and documentation. Use slash commands like /bmad:init to
bootstrap projects, /bmad:create-architecture to design systems, or
/bmad:quick-dev for rapid solo development. Derived from the open-source
BMAD-METHOD framework.

## Plugin Examples

1. **Project bootstrapping:** Run `/bmad:init` to set up a new project with the
   BMAD method structure, then `/bmad:create-product-brief` to generate a
   product brief through guided questions with the PM agent — going from zero to
   a documented product vision in one session.

2. **Architecture design:** Use `/bmad:create-architecture` with the architect
   agent to produce a full system architecture document including tech stack
   decisions, component diagrams, and data models. Follow up with
   `/bmad:create-epics-and-stories` to break it into implementable work items.

3. **Solo developer rapid workflow:** Run `/bmad:quick-spec` to quickly define a
   feature, then `/bmad:quick-dev` to implement it with built-in quality checks.
   Use `/bmad:code-review` for automated review against project standards before
   committing.
