# BMAD Plugin Project Conventions

## BMAD Agent Naming

Two distinct names for each agent:

| Term | Source | Example | Used for |
|------|--------|---------|----------|
| **Agent name** | Filename (without `.md`) | `quick-flow-solo-dev` | Invocation, delegation, code references |
| **Personnel name** | `name` field in frontmatter or heading | Barry | Documentation, user-facing display |

The agent name (filename) is the canonical identifier. Personnel names add personality but are optional in tables.
